            <span class="speaker-info">In 2013 Ben Buckley launched Wisdom & Love Prophetic Ministries – a ministry that seeks to train and equip people to walk in greater dimensions of maturity, wisdom, power and love. Wisdom & Love was inspired by a series of encounters with God in 1999 in which Ben was told to seek Love and wisdom in Christ and to speak the words God placed in his mouth. This call began a process of ongoing personal transformation and growth which is shared through Ben's messages. Wisdom & Love seeks to touch people’s heart with the message of God’s goodness, wisdom and the power of His spirit.The ministry is also based on the scripture found in:<br/>Eph 4:11-16<br/>"So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."<br />https://www.facebook.com/ben.buckley.756
