                VC3 is a Church that loves Jesus Christ and is passionate about loving people. We believe that the world needs Church now more than any time before, and it is time for the Church to go beyond its walls reaching to every man outside. We believe that the message of God’s saving grace to man remains eternal but the Church is called to make this Gospel relevant to this generation. We are a Church filled with faith, love to worship God and love his Word. VC3 now is a vibrant Church filled with people passionate for God and serving God wherever they are placed.
